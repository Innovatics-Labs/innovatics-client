        "objective": "To maintain a competitive edge, today’s organizations must gain practical knowledge of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Careers especially in engineering, data science, and technical management depend on the immense value of those advanced analytical and programming skills.\n In the Data Science & Machine Learning program from zero to hero program, an executive education program led by the Big Bang Data, you will dive deep into learning the applied mathematical structure of core machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The course focuses on the skills needed to work efficiently with machine learning models, such classification models, regression models, clustering models, and optimization. \n In this course, you will conduct your own analyses and apply the most effective methods to solve various problem types. This is what makes our program unique — we address both the how and the why of machine learning to provide you with the technical knowledge to thrive in any ML-essential field.",
